								<blockquote>No! Why, Pinnochio?</blockquote>

								<p>
									Scalding tears were brimming in my eyes before streaming down my cheeks. My sight were fixed on the flying shrapnel all over the sky. Pinnochio had sacrificed itself for the sake of my life. The two flickering infrared sensors on the ground were as though Pinnochio twinkling its eyes, bidding farewell to me. From that day onwards, I knew that I would never see it again. It all started like this...

								<blockquote>"MASTER-YOU-HAVE-AN-EMAIL-NOTIFICATION," Pinnochio blared.</blockquote>

								<p>
									A text-message appeared on the 5-inches LCD screen mounted on the robot:
								</p>

								<p>
									I was a nuclear engineer. Pinnochio was one of my invention and it had been my trusted assistant in all of my scientific endeavours since the dawn of 2020. Pinnochio was an engineering marvel of unrivalled perfection.
								</p>

								<span class="image fit"><img src="images/pinnochio_with_clipboard.jpg" alt="" /></span>

								<p>
									It was five minutes to 8 PM when I drove my sleek black Jaguar into the post 5-star hotel. Upon stepping on the ground of the elegant restaurant, I saw a tall man with a ruddy complexion sitting at one corner.
								</p>

								<p>
									Pinnochio and I approached the gentleman. The tempting aroma of the sizzling hamburger and the exotic Cappuccino on the table drifted to my nostrils. Upon seeing us, the gentleman patted his lips with a white napkin and greeted us cordially.
								</p>

								<p>
									After a succint explanation, Sir Charles handed over a cheque to me. The staggering sum of 50 million US dollars sent chills down my spine.
								</p>

								<p>
									In the dawn of 2020, the ratio of robot exceeded the ratio of humankind. Robot had become disastrous when they cooperated and worked on a lethal robotic device, the Axel-F, to drive the entire human race into extinction. Axel-F population had been growing exponentially and my 50 million-worth mission was to develop a powerful atomic nuclear bomb and plant it into their base to wipe out the Axel-F.
								</p>

								<p>
									Two weeks later, the Uranium-235 atomic bombs were almost ready to be handed over to the Russian gentleman when all of a sudden a deafening bang sent the sturdy metallic door down to the floor with an almighty CRASH! The Axel-F had ambushed into my laboratory.
								</p>

								<p>
									In a fraction of a second, Pinnochio threw me to an emergency helicopter that took off at its own accord. I was safe.
								</p>

								<p>
									"BOOOM!" An ear-splitting and nerve-shattering explosion rent the air, followed by a massive mushroom cloud billowing into the sky.
								</p>

								<blockquote>No! Why, Pinnochio?</blockquote>

									Scalding tears were brimming in my eyes before streaming down my cheeks. My sight were fixed on the flying shrapnel all over the sky. Pinnochio had sacrificed itself for the sake of my life.
